Hi there! <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/9A2JdPKx8ACikwaBMv9uRv8H0xEqFEDSKF3tPF95LF4/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YTMuZ2lwaHkuY29t/L21lZGlhL2Y0VjJt/cXZ2MHdUOW0vMjAw/LmdpZj9jaWQ9Nzkw/Yjc2MTFyZGEwNGps/Y3R5OTV1MXoxYjJo/Mmt1eDlwYXF0ZnRl/MW02Y3VxZWg4JmVw/PXYxX2dpZnNfc2Vh/cmNoJnJpZD0yMDAu/Z2lmJmN0PWc.gif" width="35" height="40"/>

I'm Thirumalai, a Software Engineer based in India, dedicated to merging technical expertise with design to create efficient and scalable applications. My passion lies in building software that not only performs well but also delivers seamless user experiences.

In my spare time, I engage in competitive programming and tackle LeetCode challenges dailyâ€”my version of a morning coffee ritual while keeping my actual coffee intake in check.

### **Fun Facts:**
- I prefer low-key tech meetups over flashy displays.
- I enjoy the company of calm and intelligent tech enthusiasts.
- One Piece is my all-time favorite anime.
